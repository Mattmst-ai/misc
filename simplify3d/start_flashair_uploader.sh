# DEBUG: debug log is written to /tmp/flashair_curl_out.txt

# Usage
# Add this line in the Simplify3D "Additional terminal commands for post processing" field.
# <path to this file> [output_filepath]
#
# Doesn't not work with Simplify3D versions prior to 3.1.0. Those versions require
# the older version of this script which accept the gcode file path as the command
# line flag and wait for the completion of the x3g generation. These problems were
# fixed in Simplify3D 3.1.0.

# NOTE: working directory is established by the caller. If need a specific
# directory, make sure to set it here.

# TODO: include upload time in completion notification.
# TODO: include useful info in error notifications (e.g. log file).
# TODO: tie notification clicks to log file
# TODO: include instructions for setting up the Flashair card.

# NOTE
# To have the notifications stay longer, in the system preference, set Notifications
# to use Alert style for terminal-notifier.
